Here is an example of code for ESP32 CAM AI THINKER with a TFT display / touchscreen and a SDCard.
V1.12 is without wifi feature.
V2.x is with display shared both on TFT and wifi, for remote display on a web browser.
Note : for the moment as long as wifi is configured any SDCard access makes the code aborting.
